About
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just an undergrad at UNC Chapel Hill getting nostalgic as I near
graduation.  I love programming for good and for fun.  There's 
satisfaction in creating.  Not everything I make is professional :)

Projects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    HackNC          <a href="https://hacknc.com/">https://hacknc.com/</a>
                
                    In thttps://he summer and fall of 2016, I lead a 
                    team to build the website and registration system 
                    for HackNC, the annual hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill.
    
    Ray Tracer      <a href="https://github.com/suBDavis/raytracer">https://github.com/suBDavis/raytracer</a>

                    I implemented a basic ray tracer in C++ to render 
                    spheres and planes with reflective surfaces and 
                    colors.

    Conway's Game   <a href="https://subdavis.com/life">https://subdavis.com/life</a>

                    I implemented an infinite version of the classic 
                    CGoL in native javascript. This is one of the first 
                    pieces of code I was ever proud of. Recycled the 
                    rendere into piksl.

    Farewell Sim.   <a href="https://quadmasterxlii.github.io/farewell-simulator">https://quadmasterxlii.github.io/farewell-simulator</a>

                    At Global Game Jam 2017, I worked with a team to 
                    build this game in 48 hours. Having no game dev 
                    experience, we worked in javascript to create a 
                    browser based street crossing game.

    MemeTrades.com  <a href="https://memetrades.com">https://memetrades.com</a>

                    This is a pretend stock market trading platform for 
                    memes. The backend for this app was challenging, as 
                    it had to process transactions synchronously for 
                    data consistency, but needed to serve content 
                    asyncronously in order to keep up with client 
                    requests and scale horizontally.

    CS Club         <a href="http://csclub.cs.unc.edu/">http://csclub.cs.unc.edu/</a>

                    During the 16-17 academic year, I was co-president 
                    of the UNC CS Club. I rewrote the website to be 
                    more streamlined and use google sheets as a backend 
                    for easy maintenance.

    This Site       <a href="https://subdavis.com/index.old.html">https://subdavis.com/index.old.html</a>

                    A previous version of this site which was built 
                    with care and existed before I decided that nice 
                    web design was overrated.
